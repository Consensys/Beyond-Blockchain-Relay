# Submission for the Reinventing the Online News Economy Bounties

## Project Name
Invest-y-gative

## Project Summary
Invest-y-gative draws upon two decades of news media experience to secure and amplify innovations in journalism as well as address major problems afflicting the news media sector generally. It does so by leveraging Web3 blockchain technology to promote:

- investigative journalism advancing the public interest;
- trust in media accuracy in an era fake news produced mass skepticism in media;
- protection of journalists and sources when their rights are in danger;
- new financial models in a long struggling media sector.

By applying distributed consensus technology to these areas, Invest-y-gative aspires to rewrite the rules and impact of digital media.

Invest-y-gative is a scientific journalism platform incentivized to serve the public interest.

Scientific journalism is a publishing methodology which includes the publication of original source documents and material along with the story. Invest-y-gative will use crypto-curation to drive investigative journalism based on the methodology of scientific journalism and the reputations of sources, journalists, and editors.

Invest-y-gative delivers:

- a transparent editorial process;
- accountability for accuracy of primary source documents;
- verification of primary source material through publication and notarization on Web3 systems;
- censorship resistance.

The dApp produced for this hackathon is a core component of Invest-y-gative project. It is the submissions layer (the submission box) and utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS as a peer-to-peer file hosting system (SWARM can also be used). It utilizes the IPFS hash of files as Proof-of-Existence and stores the proofs on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, this returns a transaction receipt certifying that the IPFS hash was registered on the blockchain. The IPFS hashes and Ethereum Transaction receipts can be linked from the investigative reports in order to verify source material and boost reader confidence in the credibility of our journalism.

## High level specs for the Invest-y-gative platform:
Users: Consumers, Sources, Journalists, Editors

Example:

Consumers: An Invest-y-gative media consumer issues a bounty of 100 ETH (of the equivalent in Invest-y-gative's token) on a story, for example, that can prove rumors that Western travel warnings to Kenya are part of a trade war on the east African country.

Other users who would like to see the story can also add to, and increase, the bounty.

Source(s): material is submitted through a Web3 Secure Dropbox which (hashed on IPFS or SWARM and notarized on the Ethereum blockchain); and/or...

Journalist(s): apply to write the story (explaining the sources they will base their story on) or are solicited by the Editors.

Editors: in considering sources, editors initiate a process of corroboration of source material (which could include crowd sourcing verification, depending on the type of source material and their level of sensitivity (ie. leaked documents vs. an image shared on social media)). Upon gaining confidence that there is enough verifiable primary source material, editors can decide to pursue the story; otherwise they will spike it. In considering journalists who apply to write the story, editors will consider the journalist's pitch, sources, previous publications, and overall reputation.

The Consumer bounty is:

- (a) held in escrow until publication,
- (b) split (in this hypothetical scenario) in thirds so that 100 ETH is divided between the source, journalist, and editor, and
- (c) paid out within 28 days of publication or n signatories (Consumers and Editors) sign off to release the bounty. Importantly, this final delay helps ensure that, after publication, the primary source material (and all sources the story relies upon) can withstand public scrutiny. Producing false (or poorly sourced) stories results, not only in a depreciated reputation as a source or journalist but, in the full bounty not being released.

## Sample material to demonstrate the importance of scientific Journalism and the role of blockchain
WikiLeaks 5th April 2010 [Collatral Murder videos](https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/) documented grave abuses of US military power "depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad -- including two Reuters news staff."

The videos were published on YouTube's centralized platform. By leveraging Web3 technologies, Invest-y-gative, would publish on distributed consensus technology that promotes Immutability (censorship resistance), Trustlessness (verification of source material), and information Disaggregation (breaking down centralized news publishing platforms) and, through cryptographic protocols, establish source and journalist protection.
